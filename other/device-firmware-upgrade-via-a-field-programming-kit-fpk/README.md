# Device Firmware upgrade via a Field Programming Kit (FPK)

All MClimate devices now support [Firmware Upgrade Over The Air (FUOTA)](../../firmware-upgrade-over-the-air-fuota.md).

However,, certain older firmware versions can only be upgraded to the latest firmware via a manual upgrade procedure that requires a set of special adapter tools directly be connected to the PCB in a certain way. Once updated to a more recent version, the device will support FUOTA, so the FPK wouldn't be required.

A proprietary MClimate software tool needs to be used to facilitate the process, which we call Field Programming Kit or FPK for short. MClimate can provide both the hardware and software tools (in the form of a pre-installed Laptop kit) in order to perform the upgrade in the field.

Take note the procedure differs depending on which MClimate device you want to upgrade. Please navigate to one of the next sections that matches yours.
