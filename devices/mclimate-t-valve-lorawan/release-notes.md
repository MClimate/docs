# ðŸ¥³ Release notes

### Firmware version 1.6

**Release date:** \
02 September 2024

* **FUOTA** functionality added;
* Bits 5 and 6 at long keep-alive message byte 1 (manual valve open/close indicators) was swapped, fixed now
* Device now exchange radio data in the common way used at all other company devices: accepts one or more get commands in a downlink and appends multiple command responses in uplink. Get command is appended always to long keep-alive command and never to short keep-alive.
* Device sends multiple get commands appended to the 1st uplink.
* Device now can operate with both unconfirmed and confirmed uplinks. By default unconfirmed are used.

Otherwise long keep-alive message with the related reason will be invoked up to 8 times by the device.
