### Firmware version 1.1

**Release date:** \
23 September 2022

* FUOTA mechanism released

{% hint style="info" %}
The FUOTA functionality differs from the FUOTA that's being used by the LoRa Alliance. In order to update the firmware version of devices, they should be connected to MClimate's cloud. It takes around 1500 downlinks to perform FUOTA. Due to duty-cycle limitations of the gateways, we recommend staging the FUOTA in smaller batches in case your installation is sizeable.

Feel free to reach out to [lorawan-support@mclimate.eu](mailto:lorawan-support@mclimate.eu) to acquire more details on the process.
