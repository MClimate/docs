# üìñ CO2 Sensor LoRaWAN Device communication protocol

## Foreword

In the current section, we explain in detail what are the specific commands that the device supports.&#x20;

If you want to make yourself familiar with the details of how this device operates, please read through all articles.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please mind that notifications can require a lot of energy depending on your configuration. E.g. if you power on the LED or Buzzer for more than the default parameters, batteries will be depleted faster.

Same is true for the CO2 check interval configuration as well as for the uplink interval. \
The default values are what we recommend. We give you the flexibility to adjust them, but deviating the default values might shorten the battery life of your devices!
