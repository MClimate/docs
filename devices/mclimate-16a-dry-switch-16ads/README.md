## Placement Guidelines

{% hint style="danger" %}
The device is intended for installation in console boxes, panels and in places that provide an insulating shell of at least 5mm to cover current-carrying parts or other conductive parts!
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
The device must be mounted to non-conductive surfaces!
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
The device must be installed in a place that ensures good cooling. Install vertically for improved cooling!
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
To be used only as a control device and not as a protection device!
{% endhint %}
